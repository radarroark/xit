 XIT IS COMING - March 4, 2025                                                  
                                                                                
   I'm working on a new version control system called <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit'>xit</a>                     
 (pronounced like "zit"). To paraphrase JFK: I do this not                      
 because it is easy...but because I thought it would be easy.                   
 It is hilarious how much I misjudged how hard this would be.                   
 Nonetheless, here are the main features:                                       
                                                                                
   1. Compatible with git hosts. You can push/pull/clone with                   
 Github and other git hosts, and nobody will even know you're                   
 using xit. I spent all of this past winter implementing the                    
 git protocol, and contrary to popular belief I am not                          
 perfect, so PLEASE REPORT BUGS!                                                
                                                                                
   2. Combine snapshot-based and patch-based version control.                   
 When you merge or cherry-pick with xit, it uses patch-based                    
 merging, which should be more reliable and lead to fewer                       
 merge conflicts than git's three-way merge. Once again,                        
 until it sees more real-world use you should temper                            
 expectations.                                                                  
                                                                                
   3. Built-in text user interface (TUI). If you just launch                    
 `xit` in a repo with no extra arguments, it will launch a                      
 TUI where you can browse commits and view the status of all                    
 uncommitted changes. Eventually the TUI will expose *all*                      
 the functionality of xit, including making commits and                         
 performing merges, but I'm not quite there yet.                                
                                                                                
   4. Store large/binary files efficiently. Internally, xit                     
 stores objects in a completely different way than git does.                    
 It uses FastCDC to break up files into chunks, somewhat like                   
 BitTorrent except the chunks are variable sized. The goal is                   
 to be excellent at storing large, binary files, so we never                    
 need an add-on like git LFS.                                                   
                                                                                
   5. Universal undo. Any change to the repo will be                            
 undoable. Yes, I mean *any* change. That includes not just                     
 changes to refs (as shown in git's reflog) but also changes                    
 to the index, the config, and so on. I'm still working on                      
 this feature so it's not available yet. It should land soon,                   
 but for now, it's vaporware.                                                   
                                                                                
   Git's 20th birthday is in April 2025. So much has changed                    
 in those two decades, and we need a tool that is free from                     
 the design limitations and technical debt that has accrued                     
 in git. If all goes well, xit will celebrate its 20th                          
 birthday in 2045 as an old incumbent being challenged by a                     
 newcomer.                                                                      
                                                                                
   If that day comes, I'll do my best to sabotage the                           
 newcomer's attempt to unseat me from the throne...just                         
 kidding, of course. I'll nod sagely in my bathrobe with a                      
 beverage in hand and continue not caring.

 DEVLOG - FASTER DIFFING/CLONING, LAZY PATCHES, AND MORE -                      
 March 21, 2025                                                                 
                                                                                
   Rejoice! xit is no longer quite as dog slow as it was                        
 before. In particular, writing objects (at the end of a                        
 clone or fetch) and generating patches are much faster now.                    
 After some investigation, it became clear that the problem                     
 was the same in both cases: xit was constantly reading small                   
 pieces of files from the disk.                                                 
                                                                                
   To solve this, I <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/68b0d14f96390d4360b2b821ab8b55a015368e19'>first</a> made it read text files fully                       
 into memory for diffing. I <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/ba86653fcc78b79c95c67613c3fd23ee35749f19'>then</a> updated the pack object                      
 reader to load objects from pack files entirely into memory                    
 (if they are below a certain file size). After these two                       
 changes, generating patches and cloning/fetching are much                      
 faster.                                                                        
                                                                                
   The UI got some love as well. I noticed that I neglected                     
 to show conflicts in the status TUI, and that has been                         
 <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/6ecbeae2fa64fc8052d7bbafc7466653efeff640'>fixed</a>. A while later, I began <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/42eaf5a69f34087dc31d3c518d754738a35a3458'>embedding</a> TUIs into my                       
 unit tests. Yes, I mean literally making assertions that                       
 embed the TUI in a big string. It's glorious...let's see you                   
 do that, GUI / web developers.                                                 
                                                                                
   I also made some critical networking fixes recently. I                       
 <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/8a2da06faf00daf232f7420b9d032d9cfdaa5bf3'>revamped</a> and <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/f312357078c5184ab0068d6ff5d07f405af212dd'>fixed</a> the http code, because it was quite                     
 badly broken for more complex fetches. Hopefully it will now                   
 be as reliable as the ssh code, which is inherently easier                     
 to get right due to its simplicity (the ssh client does most                   
 of the work, after all).                                                       
                                                                                
   After the above-mentioned performance fixes, I felt                          
 comfortable <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/ae08487e7dd0f340f64613e4eac8a8649105a367'>re-enabling</a> compression on text chunks.                          
 Previously, I had disabled it because patch generation was                     
 so slow, I didn't want to slow it down more with                               
 compression. It is now enabled, though xit repos will                          
 normally still take up much more space than git repos; there                   
 are plenty more optimizations coming.                                          
                                                                                
   Lastly, I've received a slew of great PRs from my first                      
 contributor, and <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/927def28698d516ba720c36cd3a9b4bba03b4a97'>this</a> one is worth noting. When you enable                   
 patch-based merging with `xit patch on`, it now generates                      
 the necessary patches at merge time rather than right away.                    
 If you actually want to generate them all in advance, you                      
 can do `xit patch all`. Generating them lazily is a great                      
 idea because it allows you to delay the work until it's                        
 needed, and only do the work for commits that are involved                     
 in the merge.

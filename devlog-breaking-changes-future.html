 DEVLOG - ZIG'S BREAKING CHANGES AND THE FUTURE OF XIT -                        
 September 16, 2025                                                             
                                                                                
   In the last six months, my pace with the xit project                         
 slowed down a lot, both for personal and technical reasons.                    
 I hit some snags in my personal life that I'm still working                    
 through. I'm sure some reading this can relate to the                          
 experience where ordinary pains in life can sap your                           
 once-limitless energy and excitement over a project. The                       
 project didn't change; only your brain did.                                    
                                                                                
   On the technical side, zig 0.15 brought an avalanche of                      
 breaking changes, most of which affected xit. Through sheer                    
 force of will I got it all working in one huge <a href='https://github.com/radarroark/xit/commit/34695c9f87c5c5eb4650fc55c04a23dfadaa64a6'>commit</a>, but                   
 it looks like 0.16 will be even more work for me once it is                    
 released.                                                                      
                                                                                
   Currently xit is still using the old-style readers and                       
 writers, including many custom ones, that were deprecated as                   
 part of <a href='https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html#Writergate'>writergate</a>. In 0.16 it looks like they'll be                         
 removed completely, so I will need to convert them to use                      
 the new design everywhere.                                                     
                                                                                
   Additionally, zlib compression was removed from 0.15's std                   
 lib, and there is no indication that the removal is                            
 temporary. As a stopgap measure, I was able to just copy                       
 that code into the xit project. However, it relies on the                      
 old-style writers so it won't work once 0.16 is out. So,                       
 I'll need to rewrite it to use the new writer interface, or                    
 find another implementation.                                                   
                                                                                
   I don't want this to sound like complaining. The                             
 writergate changes clearly make zig better, and arguably I                     
 "signed up for this" by using an unstable language. That                       
 said, at my reduced capacity, I wasn't prepared for this                       
 level of breakage this late in the game. I'm hoping I'll get                   
 another burst of motivation to support future versions of                      
 zig so my 2+ years of effort don't turn into bitrot.
